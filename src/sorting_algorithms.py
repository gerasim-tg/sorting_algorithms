    """
    Merge sort is a very efficient sorting algorithm. O(n log n)
    Itâ€™s based on the divide-and-conquer approach, a powerful algorithmic technique 
    used to solve complex problems.
    
    The second step splits the input array recursively and calls merge() for each half. Since the array is halved until a single element remains, the total number of halving operations performed by this function is log2n. Since merge() is called for each half, we get a total runtime of O(n log2n).

    Interestingly, O(n log n) is the best possible worst-case runtime that can be achieved by a sorting algorithm.

    Limitations:
    Another drawback of merge sort is that it creates copies of the array 
    when calling itself recursively. It also creates a new list inside merge() 
    to sort and return both input halves. 
    This makes merge sort use much more memory than bubble sort and insertion sort, 
    which are both able to sort the list in place.

    Due to this limitation, you may not want to use merge sort to sort large lists in 
    memory-constrained hardware.
